# Thief detecteion system (mbed 1769 + Raspberry Pi)

### Project idea

This project aims to implment a thief detection system for a room/house. The idea is to install a camera and an ultrasonic sensor on the room you want to secure. The ultrasonic points in one angle and the camera on a different one (ideally we would have multiple ultrasonic sensors and cameras, but for simplicity we just have one of each).

The ultrasonic detects a thief if he is close enough to the sensor. The camera is connected to a Raspberry Pi which is running an object detection model using tensorflow and opencv, so it detects the thief using this model. 

When a thief is detected, the alarm will sound on the speaker, a red blinking light will be turn on (a led for simplicity) and the door will be automatically closed (a motor in our case).

### Code
#### MBED code

The most important thing of the MBED code is the use of threads for each component

```
#include "Mutex.h"
#include "Thread.h"
#include "mbed.h"
#include "rtos.h"
#include "SDFileSystem.h"
#include "wave_player.h"

#include "Mutex.h"

DigitalOut motor(p21);
DigitalOut red_led(p24);
bool thieves = 0;
DigitalOut led1(LED1);

AnalogOut DACout(p18);
wave_player waver(&DACout);

void dist(int distance){
    
    if (distance < 700 && thieves == 0){
        thieve_m.lock();
        thieves = 1;
        Thread::wait(6000);
        thieves = 0;
        thieve_m.unlock();

            }
            waver.play(wave_file);
            fclose(wave_file);  
            Thread::wait(200);   
        }
    }
}

void thread_ultrasonic(void const * args){

    mu.startUpdates();
    while(1){
        mu.checkDistance();

        }
        else{
            red_led = !red_led;
        }
        Thread::wait(700);
    }
}

int main()
{
    Thread t2(thread_Music);
    Thread t3(thread_color);
    Thread t4(thread_ultrasonic);
    Thread t5(thread_motor);
    while(1){
        char val = 0;
        while(pi.readable()) {
            val = pi.getc();
            if(val == 'T' && thieves == 0){
                    thieve_m.lock();
                    thieves = 1;
                    Thread::wait(6000);
                    thieves = 0;
                    thieve_m.unlock();            
            }
        }
        Thread::wait(500);
    }
}
```

### Conclusions + future work

In this project we have showcased the capabilities of the mbed at the time of managing multple compenents using threads and connecting to a raspeberry pi for recieving data. Adittionally we have showed how to run object detection models on the raspberri PI.

For future enhancements it would be interesting to install a camera that could rotate in all angles. Installing more ultrasonic sensors could also result in a more capable system.
Finally it would also be important to integrate all the wiring within one single box.
